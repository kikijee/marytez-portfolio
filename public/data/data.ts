This work is inspired by Japanese folklore as well as by manga artists such as Daijiro Morohoshi, and Shigeru Mizuki, utilizing monsters or yokai illustrations, to depict the corrupt state of the world. PLANET 30XX expresses themes such as the loss of humanity, loneliness, chaos, and the psychology of monsters. In this vision of the future, humans have succumbed to their technological devices, becoming one with them. They hold televisions on their heads and proceed detached from the world around them. The monsters within this world are reflections of our age-old sins such as greed and our self-destructive tendencies that include the devastation of the natural world of which we are a part. The monsters represent the accumulation of the desire for wealth, money, fame, and an overall aspiration to conform to accepted social norms and beauty standards, ultimately resulting in the lack of individuality. However, there is still hope, emerging from a desire to change the trajectory of this warped world. Those who acknowledge the state of the dying Earth and challenge this destructive trajectory are the only ones who can save us.",
